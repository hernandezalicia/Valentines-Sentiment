This application showcases a variety of analysis on Twitter data collected
surrounding Valentine's Day of 2019.<br><br>

An (R Script) was run daily beginning January 31, 2019 until February 17, 2019
to collect Twitter data containing the phrase "Valentine's Day". A maximum daily
collection threshold was set at 50,000 tweets, this threshold was not met each
day. The data collection process resulted in a data set of approximately
<b>750,000</b> total tweets. <br><br>

A second (R Script) was run to pre-process and clean the tweets to prepare them
for the analysis showcased in this application. A variety of processess were
performed to identify and remove tweets which were considered to be <b>spam</b>.
This application may be expanded in the future to include an analysis of spam
tweets.
